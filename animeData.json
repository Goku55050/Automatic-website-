    "description": "Jujutsu Kaisen follows the story of Yuji Itadori, a high school student with incredible physical strength who lives a normal life until he encounters Curses. Curses are born from negative human emotions and cause misfortune and death, and can only be fought by other Curses. To save a friend attacked by Curses, Yuji consumes a cursed object—the finger of Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses—and becomes a vessel for Sukuna. Following this event, Yuji is guided by powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo and joins the Tokyo Jujutsu High School of Sorcery to fight Curses, embarking on a path from which he cannot return. ",
